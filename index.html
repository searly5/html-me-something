<h1 style = "font-size:5vw"><b>My 5 Favorite Vacations</b></h1>

<p style = "font-size:2vw"> 1)  My favorite trip was to Ireland.  My husband is Irish and we always wanted to go so he and I went for a week several years ago. 
We saw so many wonderful places and experienced history in a way we never could in the U.S.  
The landscapes were as beautiful as the people.  It's a trip I'll never forget!</p>

<p style = "font-size:2vw"> 2)  San Francisco.  I was so surprised how much I loved San Francisco.  There was so much to do and to see and I was truly surprised by the culture.  We were able to listen to live music and around each corner were foods from every part of the world.  The weather was amazing and surprisingly we were able to walk to quite a few places.  It was a truly lovely city.</p>

<p style = "font-size:2vw"> 3)  Disney Cruise.  What an experience!  I had never been on a cruise.  My kids absolutely loved it, especially when we stopped at Disney's private island, Castaway Cay.  We saw several Disney shows on the ship and ate anytime we wanted.  It was a trip filled with wonderful memories(but I didn't enjoy being sea-sick).</p>

<p style = "font-size:2vw"> 4)  Destin, FL.  We have been to several beaches but the beach in Destin is just so beautiful because of the soft white sand.  There is also so much to do there for any age.  We have been there a couple of different times and it was just a fun, relaxing place to visit and spend quality time with the family.</p>

<p style = "font-size:2vw"> 5)  Cancun, Mexico.  What's not to like about a resort in Cancun?  I went on a girls trip and we had so much fun from the beach to the spa and everything in between.  Great trip to catch up on some reading and fall asleep by the beach.  I highly recommend if you're looking for some true R&R.</p>
